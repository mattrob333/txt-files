Dominate The Diamond,2023-03-31,Top 5 ways to Hit For More POWER in Baseball,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRx1xE_byNc,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xRx1xE_byNc/maxresdefault.jpg,4:55,"We are going to demonstrate five ways to help players hit for more power. The first drill involves using a medicine ball to work on explosive movements and throwing power. The second drill uses different weighted balls to help players drive through the ball and make solid contact. The third drill is the walk-through drill, where players take a full swing and follow through with two steps towards the pitcher's mound. The fourth drill is the skater or step back drill, which focuses on coiling up on the backside and unloading on the ball. Finally, the fifth drill involves sitting on a bucket to help players maintain good posture and feel their backside stay down in their legs during their swing. These drills aim to improve a player's hitting power by building strength, improving technique, and maintaining good posture.

This video provides top five ways to hit money fungos (a type of baseball drill) in a coaching setting. The first way is to toss the ball a little bit in front of the left knee, choking up on the bat, and making a smooth swing. The second way is to hit fly balls by tossing the ball higher and ground balls by tossing the ball lower. The third way is to use a smaller bat (e.g., a T-ball or little league bat) and toss the ball in front of the left knee. The fourth way is to use a tennis racket instead of a bat to hit pop flies. The video provides a step-by-step demonstration for each of these ways.

00:00 Intro
0:34 Using Correct Form with a Fungo Bat
1:29 Tossing at the Right Height

Duke breaks down the fielding triangle, throwing mechanics, and fly ball mechanics.

At such a young age, the best way to instill information into these players are to allow them to have fun and using simple terms. Many times coaches train youth players the same way they train high school athletes. You have to know the attention span, the development level, and remember they are just kids looking for an experience to have fun!

He said he visualizes driving the ball into the opposite side of the field gap to ensure successful and powerful contact.

Then he brings us into his three plate drill. The plates are arranged going toward the coach doing the front toss. The drill focuses on time and rhythm to avoid being rushed or beginning the swing too early. The plate farthest from the coach simulates a slow pitch/change up, the middle plate simulates an average pitcher, while the closest plate simulates a pitcher that throws very hard. Meanwhile, the coach throws the ball at the exact same speed, using the distance to create the differences in the drill.

The player's goal is to stay at the same pace and rhythm no matter what plate they are swinging at. They should adjust to the different pitches by changing what time they begin their load, whether it is during when the pitcher first starts moving or while the ball is on its way toward the plate, the adjustments avoid rushing or being too early.

Too often, youth coaches all yell and scream out instructions & directions from the dugout.  This can be confusing for players because each coach might be yelling out something different!

Sit down with your coaching staff and go over each coaches job during practice & at games.  It can be challenging to monitor the whole game all at once.  For example, you can have one coach managing the pitch calling, another coach working with infielders, one coach working with the hitters/offense, and the last coach working with the outfielders/positioning and where they should be playing.  This gives each coach a specific responsibility during the games and one thing to focus on.

Remember, we're not playing a video game!  We can't just yell and scream out where the ball needs to go.  Teach in practice and let your players learn from failure in the game!

Here at Dominate the Diamond, we created Baseball IQ cards to teach the players on our team certain situations and what to do in them.

We can never assume that our players will understand situations, defensive assignments, situational hitting, reading the pace of the ball, knowing the speed of the runner etc... As coaches, we need to walk through these situations in practice, use a dry erase board and slow down our teaching to explain the ""why"" not just the ""how.""

We love to set up certain situations at practice with runners and hitters to make practice more game-like.  Spread your coaches out around the field and talk to the individual players.  Also, moving your players around so they have a well-rounded understanding of the game instead of just their position will increase their baseball IQ as a whole.

Dominate The Diamond,2022-05-20,Position Players Throwing Warmup Routine (YOUTH BASEBALL),,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaQMNt6eRwQ,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XaQMNt6eRwQ/maxresdefault.jpg,3:14,"During your teams throwing progression, it's always important to replicate movements that are going to happen during the games.  Long tossing is a great way to increase arm strength, but adding in situations to make it game-like will help with the players footwork, momentum and moving through the ball.

1.  For infielders, you can simulate quick hands, tags, cuts & relays, routine plays, back hands and slow rollers.

2.  For outfielders, you can work on crow hops, pro steps, working around the ball, creating angles and over the shoulder plays.

All of these movements and the footwork for each of them can be done everyone we warm up in pre-game.

Youth baseball and softball coaches need to talk about the rules, guidelines & expectations on the very first practice.

Hustling, attitude & effort are just some of the key topics that need to be discussed on day 1!  We tell our youth baseball and softball players that hustling on the field is something that needs to happen.  It doesn't matter if we're winning, losing, or tied going into the last inning... our teams will always sprint to our positions and sprint back off the field when the inning is over.

Using our sample base running cards, we show you several different ways to implement these circuits into your practice plans.

Instead of having 1 line of players running from 1st base try something like this!

Home Plate - have a group working on hard turns around 1st base
1st Base - have a group working on straight steals to 2nd base
2nd Base - have  group working on dirt ball reads
3rd Base - have a group working on tagging up and scoring

This keeps the players moving, keeps the players engaged and moving in a fast paced environment.

These are all examples of situations that happen throughout the game that can be challenging to cover during practice sessions.

We simplify how to efficiently run practice that will keep the kids engaged the whole time.

We discuss practice plans all the time in our courses.  Our job as coaches is to prepare a practice plan to make the most efficient use of our time and space at practices.  Get creative and keep practice moving!  This will keep your players focused and engaged for short amount of times!

Break your players into small groups, create stations, and keep the kids moving!  In this video we discuss running a circuit where a pitcher is on the mound, and we have base runners at each base to simulate a different situation.  Rather than just putting 1 line of players working on steal breaks, have each group work on something different.  You can have pitchers work on throwing to a batter, the group from 1st base work on straight steals, the group from 2B work on dirt ball reads, and the group from 3B work on tagging up.

Players of all ages put so much pressure on themselves to succeed.  Remember that baseball and softball are games of failure.  These kids are going to fail way more than they succeed, especially in hitting.  Our job as coaches is to push our players at practice, put pressure on them and teach them how to handle failure and adversity.

Practice time is our time and Game time is for the players.  During the game, we want to motivate our team and help them believe that they are prepared and can compete with any opponent.  When a player is struggling, pull them to the side, put your arm around them and let them know it's okay!  Teach your players what it means to pick up their teammates and remember - it all starts with us as coaches!

When the catcher sets up to make a tag out at home plate, the positioning will vary depending on where the ball is hit.  Make sure that the mask stays on when we make the tag out.  We should position our heels on the front corner of the plate for a straight away throw from CF.  Try to get a good read on the throw, read the hops, the angle and get your chest lined up to the throw.

As a catcher, we have to let the runner have a ""sliding lane"" before the ball is in our glove.  Once the ball is in our glove, we can then position our body to block home plate.  After we catch the ball, we want to lean and drive to the left  towards the runner sliding into the plate.  Remember to hold the ball in our bare hand in the glove.  At times, we may have to use a 1 hand swipe tag technique but at the younger ages we prefer to use 2 hands.  Once we apply the tag, sell it to the umpire and get ready for the next play with less than 2 outs!

In practice, it's our job as coaches to create multiple stations at practice.  Instead of doing base running with one line of players working on running to 1B, have a few players at each base working on something different.

Here is a sample base running circuit for you to try out with your teams.

1. Coach is standing on the mound as the pitcher for each base.
2. Have 4 players at home plate working on sprinting through 1B.
3. Have 4 players at 1B working on steal breaks off the pitcher.
4.  Have 4 players 2B working on secondary leads and reading the third base coach.

This circuit can be changed weekly and you'll see your teams get a lot more reps in on the base paths.

Coach Brandon Martorano is a SF Giant prospect catcher and he shares his measurement he has used his whole career of catching.

The proper set up for the catcher behind home plate is to have a batter stand in the batters box in practice.  The catcher should be able to reach out and touch the batters back knee.  If the catcher is too close, the catcher runs the risk of getting hit by the bat in the helmet or with their glove.

If the catcher is too far back, we will be receiving the ball too deep and make strikes look like balls down in the zone.  Have your catchers work on this in practice so they have the confidence to set up correctly in the game.

Especially at the younger ages, the dynamic warm-up sets the tone for the rest of the day.  It's important that we as coaches are prepared for pre-game routines.  Make sure your players build up a sweat, get the blood flowing and prepare their bodies for the first pitch of the game.

It's also important that during pre-game, coaches bring props and tools to create multiple stations during pre-game.  Don't just have 1 kid hit when the rest of the players are standing around and watching.  Whether you use smush balls, wiffle balls or heavy balls, create multiple stations to keep the kids moving and loose before the game starts!

In this video, we discuss the importance of teaching your players in multiple ways, giving them home work and breaking things down in a simple way.

It's important that when at practice, we break things down into language that they understand!  We can never assume that our players understand everything that we say.  Slow things down, teach a skill and do your best to show your players how it applies to the game situations.

Using a skill or drill, take certain stations and turn them into competitions.  Using this progression, it allows your players to understand the meaning and purpose behind each drill.  It's also important to put them into situations in practice and let them know it's okay to fail!  We're not playing  a video game as coaches... Players need to play, fail and learn from their failure.  Ask questions, get in their head and try to understand their perspective.

Dominate The Diamond,2022-02-20,Don't Be Afraid of the Ball (HIT BY PITCH),Baseball Hitting Drills & Pro Tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEROLAzdNoM,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEROLAzdNoM/maxresdefault.jpg,6:00,"Coaches Duke Baxter and Steve Nikorak shares their personal experiences getting hit by pitches and how to confidently teach youth players how to overcome the fear of getting hit.

Getting hit by the ball and being afraid to hit is something that all youth baseball and softball players go through.  There are a few simple steps to take when trying to build confidence or re assure your players that getting hit by the ball is part of the game!

1.  Teach your players how to get hit correctly!
       a. Turn in & Tuck the Chin
       b. Drop the Barrel
       c. This allows them to get hit in the meaty parts of their body where it doesn't hurt as    bad.

2. Mix in balls during front toss or BP to show them that they have time to get hit if the ball is thrown at them.
      a. Use tennis balls, smush ball, or incredi-balls to hit them in their back side.
      b.  This will give them the confidence to get out of the way on time.

3. Try to get the message through to them that getting hit is part of the game!  It may only happen a handful of times all season.  We don't want to waste hundred's of at bats worried about something that may only happen 1, 2, 3 times a year.

Especially for youth players and teams, this is crucial for you coaches.

There are a few things that are crucial in running the perfect practice.

1. Utilize your assistant coaches!  Break the players up by skill level and have each coach working with a small group of 4-5 players at a time.

2.  Create stations and use the whole field.  Having a game plan of using the entire field is another great way to keep players focused and engaged.  Don't have 1 person getting their work in while everyone else is sitting and watching.

3.  Do drills in small, controlled settings for 5-10 minutes max.  Especially with younger players, we want to keep their focus and keep them moving.  Doing one thing for a long time can get boring and kids will lose their focus.

4.  Keep notes during the games!  We know that all youth coaches are volunteers.  Keep an index card and keep track of the things that need to be addressed at practice for the upcoming week and your practice plan is created for you!

Coach Duke and Steve teach you how to throw the best batting practice for efficiency and productivity.  This is something that often gets overlooked in youth baseball.  We tell our players to practice all the time so it's our job as coaches to work on how well we can throw batting practice.

Remember, we don't have to go back and throw batting practice from 60 feet.  Add in side toss, front toss and seated BP to have more control over where your throws are going.  Coaches tend to be a lot more accurate when throwing from close range and it also allows the players to work on timing from different distances.

For coaches that struggle with accuracy, you can set up a target or a catcher behind home plate to help with throwing strikes.  It's also important to give your players a second in between pitches to get set up and ready.  Rushing your players through batting practice can be counter-productive and causes bad habits when rushed.

There are a few things we have to focus on when teaching players to slide correctly.
1.  The player must get into the “Figure 4” position and tuck the one leg under our lead leg.
2.  The player should make a fist to protect their fingers from jamming into the ground.
3.  The player must go full speed!  A lot of players slow down before getting to the base.

Dominate The Diamond,2021-12-03,CONNECTION BALL DRILL | Prevent Long Swings,Softball Drills,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUKt87-4Bu0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zUKt87-4Bu0/maxresdefault.jpg,1:56,"There are several ways to use a connection ball.  For younger players, you can even use a dodge ball if the connection ball is too big.  Using the connection ball or dodge ball will help your players in several different ways.
1.  Placing the ball on the back shoulder will help your players stay tight and quick to contact.  In the first drill, the player tries to keep the dodgeball in between her back shoulder and the top of the handle.  This helps to be efficient, to maintain her connection and keep her bat path to contact as quick as possible.
2.  When done incorrectly, you can see the dodge ball falls out behind home plate.  Sage demonstrates this by “casting” or losing her barrel too early in the swing.  Ideally, the ball will fall out towards 1st or 2nd base for right handed hitters.
3.  To see more videos like this and how to add the connection ball into your hitting routine, check out the links below!

Dominate The Diamond,2021-11-10,Little League Cuts and Relays | DONE RIGHT!,The Best Infield Drills & Pro Tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yle6R1-flA8,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yle6R1-flA8/maxresdefault.jpg,2:34,"What happens when the ball is hit into the outfield with runners on base? Where do the fielders go and line up? Where do the outfielders go when the ball is hit to them? Every fielder has an obligation to go somewhere during a cut and relay situation. We are here to help you understand cuts and relays and how to coach it.

Cuts and relays are important for coaches and players to be able to coach and execute so watch this video.
Things to remember for the infielders;
1.  Be in an athletic position with your chest facing the outfielder with your hands up
2.  As the ball is in the air position your body so you are catching the ball over your glove shoulder and ready to throw once you catch it
3. Read the ball and recognize a short throw, long throw, or ball off target.

Here is a fun drill you can use with your ball players to help them properly perform a relay throw.
1.  Set up a target for them to throw into
2. Line up your players to the side
3. Hit or throw the ball to them and make sure they are catching the ball glove side
4. Have them throw the ball into the target after they catch the ball.
5. Make a competition out of it by placing a bullseye on the net or trying to knock a ball off a tee.

I hope this helps you teach the proper cut and relay in a fun and educational way!

Dominate The Diamond,2021-11-04,How to Soft Toss | YOUTH BASEBALL AND SOFTBALL,Baseball Hitting Drills & Pro Tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV3EQ5tHcNE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rV3EQ5tHcNE/maxresdefault.jpg,1:50,"A typical drill used in practices and before games is the highly used Soft Toss or Side Toss.

This drill is great to help warm up your players and to get their bodies ready for batting practice.
You can use side toss as a station during practice, as a warm up before a game, or whenever your players just wants to take a few swings.  We are using hard balls and Smushballs for this drill. We use hard balls if coaches are doing the tossing, and then we use Smushballs in smaller areas or if a player is flipping to another player.

Here is how you Side Toss.
1. Present the ball to the hitter by showing it to them so they get ready.
2. Bring the hand back slow and keep the tempo the same throughout the toss.
3. When you toss the ball aim for the front pocket or belt area of the hitter.
4. You can mix up the locations but stay smooth and toss the ball in front of the hitter.
Always remember to take your time as the tosser so that the hitter can get ready and repeat the movement.

I hope you enjoy the drill!

Dominate The Diamond,2021-08-13,3 great drills for teaching kids how to catch fly balls | Youth baseball fielding drills,The Best Infield Drills & Pro Tips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnfgd_ld_CM,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lnfgd_ld_CM/maxresdefault.jpg,4:27,"We often get asked, what's the best way to help youth baseball players learn to catch fly balls in the infield or outfield.  We have 3 great drills that the players love and really help them to judge fly balls and learn to catch them while having a great time.

The first is the flyball competition drill.  This can be done inside or outside.  Have players toss their baseball in the air and the first one to catch 5 (or 10) flyballs wins.  It sounds simple but especially with the young kids, they'll be throwing them all over the place and have to run for them and judge where they'll land.  Use squishy balls with the younger kids.

The second drill for practicing catching fly balls is the zig zag drill.  Set up cones in a zig zag pattern on the field.  Then have a coach throw to the player and have them use their prep step in  zig zag motion as their catching the fly ball.

The third drill that the kids love is the Squishy Fly Ball Drill.  Using a squishy ball throw a fly ball and have the kids ""catch it"" with the rim of their hat.  This requires them to position themselves under the ball.  They have a blast and it helps them learn how to judge where the ball will land.

Coach Duke demonstrates a skillful drill that breaks down the proper arm slots for infielders. A lot of times infielders need to make close plays and their technique can determine if the runner is safe or out. The infielder's arm slot is crucial, especially once the players get to a more advanced level like high school or college baseball.

In this fast paced video, Steve Nikorak demonstrates a drill for throwing on the run and working on making your players comfortable with uncomfortable throws. With only 2 cones, the players can gather the necessary skills for accuracy toward first base at any speed or positioning. The baseball players sprint through the cones, simulate fielding the ball, transfer weight onto the right leg, and throw at any body angle, as would happen in the real game.
