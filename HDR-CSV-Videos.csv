PVC is such a great tool for awareness and visuals. The length really helps young baseball and softball players understand direction and angles in their swing.
If you haven’t implemented PVC into your young hitter’s routine you should do so immediately if they are struggling with consistency and understanding of their baseball or softball swing.
