Premier 1A Jet Charter Information

Dear Passenger,

Thank you for choosing our Premier 1A jet for your private travel needs. To ensure a safe and enjoyable flight, we have provided guidelines on how to calculate your flight cost and manage your baggage within the aircraft’s weight limitations.

Calculating Flight Cost: To calculate the total cost of your trip, please use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Flight Time x Fuel Cost per Hour) + (Flight Time x Power by the Hour) + (Number of Days x Flight Crew Cost per Day)

Our cost structure:

Fuel cost per hour: $1,001.00
Power by the hour: $200.00
Flight crew cost per day: $1,200.00

Example Trip Calculation: If you were to take a trip from New York (JFK) to Miami (MIA) on our Premier 1A jet, which is a distance of approximately 1,090 nautical miles, and assuming a flight time of 2.5 hours, the total cost for this trip would be:

Total Cost = (2.5 hours x $1,001.00/hour) + (2.5 hours x $200.00/hour) + (1 day x $1,200.00/day) Total Cost = $2,502.50 + $500.00 + $1,200.00 Total Cost = $4,202.50

Baggage and Weight Guidelines: To ensure compliance with the Premier 1A jet’s weight limitations, please use the following formula to estimate the total passenger and baggage weight:

Total Passenger and Baggage Weight = Number of Passengers x Average Passenger Weight + Total Baggage Weight

Assume an average passenger weight of 180-200 pounds and add the weight of your baggage. The maximum landing weight of the Premier 1A is 11,600 lbs, so the estimated total passenger and baggage weight should not exceed this limit.

Example Weight Calculation: Let’s say there are four passengers on the Premier 1A jet and they estimate their baggage to weigh a total of 400 pounds. Using the formula above, the total passenger and baggage weight would be:

Total Passenger and Baggage Weight = 4 x 190 lbs (assuming an average passenger weight of 190 lbs) + 400 lbs Total Passenger and Baggage Weight = 760 lbs + 400 lbs Total Passenger and Baggage Weight = 1,160 lbs

Please remember to double-check your calculations and verify with the aircraft operator to ensure compliance with all weight and balance limitations.

We hope this information helps you plan your trip on our Premier 1A jet. If you have any questions or would like to book a flight, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Safe travels!
